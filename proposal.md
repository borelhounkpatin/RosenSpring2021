# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Virtual Roulette Wheel

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A roulette game where you can place bets on the board and keep track of winnings.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The user can choose from a variety of betting options on the virtual roulette board, each of which will have a function on the program that calculates the winnings/losses based on the outcome of the wheel. There will be a global variable for the winnings, and the user will be given the option to cash out before every turn. There will be a function to check the user input, as well as a function that spins the wheel, returning the number and the color. The bet function will then calculate the winnings based on the odds of the bet and add it to the total.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A wheel and virtual board, user choices to keep/stop playing, and a few betting options.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Most betting options available. Color, even/odd, and single number bets will be fairly easy to implement, but the more complicated bets will a bit trickier. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope to include every possible bet in the game of roulette, including corner bets, six number bets and all outside bets. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Borel and I have split up the work fairly evenly. I am handling the gameplay aspect, such as user input, the spin function, the money count, etc. and Borel has started working on betting functions. I am not very familiar with how the odds work for every type of bet, so I still have some research to do to figure out how to calculate the results.
